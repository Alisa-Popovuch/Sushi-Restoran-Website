### :hammer_and_wrench: About Website
<p>The site was designed and created for a sushi restaurant. There are sections with different pages; when you go to each, you can find out more detailed information. A menu has been developed for viewing, the ability to reserve a table online or leave a review about the establishment.</p>
<p>In the future, when improving the site, I would like to give you the opportunity to immediately order from your favorite menu items when booking a table.</p>

  <p>Several different types of animation were used when creating the site.</p>
  <p>A feedback form is used, which makes it possible to write a review or ask a question, as well as book a table in advance.</p>
